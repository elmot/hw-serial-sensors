Vaadin/Chrome hardware access example
==============

This project is a demonstration hoew to use Chrome App APIs to access hardware devices. Hardware part of the project is a stack of two  ST Microelectronics boards:
* [MCU Board](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-nucleo/nucleo-l152re.html)
* [Sensor Board](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/ecosystems/stm32-open-development-environment/stm32-nucleo-expansion-boards/stm32-ode-sense-hw/x-nucleo-iks01a1.html)
 
The hardware is connected to a host PC through on-board virtual UART interface, and Chrome application is connected to it.
